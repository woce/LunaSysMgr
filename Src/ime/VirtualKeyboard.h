/*

	Interface for virtual keyboards implemented inside system manager, so that we can have different kinds of keyboards (tablet, phone, pinyin?...)
	co-exist in the code base without risky overlap.

	To create a new virtual keyboard:
	 1 - create a virtual keyboard derived from VirtualKeyboard, which implements the interfaces of VirtualKeyboard & InputMethod (it derives from both)
	 2 - create a factory for it: Derive from VirtualKeyboardFactory, implement the "create()" method, and create a static object for that factory. Example:

			class TabletKeyboardFactory : public VirtualKeyboardFactory
			{
			public:
				TabletKeyboardFactory() : VirtualKeyboardFactory("Tablet Keyboard")		{}
				InputMethod *	create(IMEDataInterface * dataInterface)				{ return new TabletKeyboard(dataInterface); }
			};

			static TabletKeyboardFactory sTabletKeyboardFactory;

	 3 - IMEManager will have to be told to use that keyboard. How this happens remains tbd, but IMEManager now has the list of names & the means to construct the keyboard.
