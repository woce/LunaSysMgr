/**
 * Base class for reference counted objects
 * 
 * This class keeps a "reference count" of how many other objects currently reference this object
 * so it is not deleted from memory while other objects are still using it.  By deriving from this
 * class, subclasses will automatically clean themselves up from memory once they are no longer being
 * used.
 * 
 * Every time a new pointer is created that points to this object, the code managing the pointer should
 * call {@link RefCounted::ref() RefCounted::ref()} to increment the reference count, indicating that
 * there's something new referencing this instance.  When that pointer is no longer going to be used,
 * the code managing the pointer should call {@link RefCounted::deref() RefCounted::deref()} to
 * decrement the reference count, indicating that there is one less pointer to this object floating
 * around in memory.  When this object detects that the reference count reaches zero (meaning that there
 * is nothing currently using the object), {@link RefCounted::deref() RefCounted::deref()} automatically
 * cleans it up from memory.
 * 
 * This class is not intended to be instantiated on its own, though there is nothing preventing that.
 * It is designed as a utility base class for other classes to derive from.  With this class around, all
 * you have to do to have your object automatically clean up its own memory is to derive from this class.
 * The functionality in RefCounted takes care of all of the details for you.

/**
 * Smart pointer object
 * 
 * @todo Limit this class to only being used on derivatives of RefCounted.
 * 
 * Smart pointers are a way of having a pointer that automatically tracks use and cleans up the
 * object it points to when nobody is using it.  It's a convenience class so pointer users don't
 * have to worry about cleaning up objects they're pointing to.  If everything that uses a
 * pointer uses this class, memory should stay much cleaner over long running times by preventing
 * memory leaks from code not explicitly cleaning up the memory it uses.
 * 
 * This class is basically a drop-in replacement for a regular pointer which can be used for
 * pointing to any class that derives from {@link RefCounted RefCounted}.  It handles the details
 * of tracking the reference count automatically.  By using this smart pointer object, you should
 * never have to worry about calling {@link RefCounted::ref() RefCounted::ref()},
 * {@link RefCounted::deref() RefCounted::deref()}, or cleaning up memory.
